        public void tellTheSeasonByMonthNumber(int month) {
        }

number is Aliquot(prints:"Aliquot" is yes otherwise "Not aliquot") to the other:

        }
    }

#### 3. Is symbol english determiner.

Basic Salary > 20000 : taxes - 20%

    public class SalaryCalculator {
        public void calculateSalary(int salary) {
        }
    }

#### 5. Divider.

Implement the program to check and print whether a number from method argument is divisible by 5 and 11 or
not by using if-else(print "Dividable" if so otherwise "Non-dividable" and if 0 -> "cannot divide by zero"):

    public class Divider {
        public void isDividableBy5And11(int number) {
        }
    }

#### 6. Alphabetic characters.

Implement the program that will consume a character from method argument which will be from
english alphabet and print vowel if it is "Vowel" or consonant if it's "Consonant". And If it is not from eng alphabet

of days in that month, if number is not a month number -> print: "wrong number!":

        }
    }
