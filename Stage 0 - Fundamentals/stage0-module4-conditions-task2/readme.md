# Tasks:

#### 1. Greatest number printer.

Implement the program that will find the greatest number from two that are passed as
parameters to the method and print the greatest. In case of equality print any of them. Implement program in the code
snippet:

        public class GreatestNumberPrinter {
            public void printGreatest(int first, int second) {
            }
        }

#### 2. Coin flip.

Implement the program which will consume 1 number in method arguments and if the number is less than 500
print "Eagle" otherwise "Tail" (range of numbers is [1-1000], no checks for that required):

    public class CoinFlip {
        public void throwCoin(int from1UpTo1000) {
        }
    }
